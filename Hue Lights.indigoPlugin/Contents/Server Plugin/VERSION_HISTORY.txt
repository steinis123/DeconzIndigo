The "Set Brightness with Ramp Rate" action already had this capability).
* Added ability to use an Indigo variable for color temperature in the "Set Color Temperature" action.
--

--
1.3.9
* Fixed another bug that caused the plugin to crash if a Hue Group had no color mode defined on the Hue hub (e.g. all the group members were non-color bulbs).

1.3.1
* Fixed a bug that could cause a plugin crash if a string was passed as the ramp rate in a Python script when executing any action that sets color.
--

* Added ellipses to Plugins menu Preset items to conform to standard menu item naming convention when a dialog results from selecting a menu item.
--
1.2.0 (25-Aug-2013)
* Added Hue device settings Presets option that can save a device's current settings to be recalled (applied) later to any other compatible Hue device.
* Fixed a bug that would cause Hue devices to not turn off if the requested brightness level was 0 when using the Set RGB, Set HSB, Set Color Temperature, or Set xyY actions.
--
1.1.1 (20-Aug-2013)
* Added code to update device error states if a Hue device's online state changes to false, or there's some other kind of error.
* Corrected some UI labeling errors.
--
1.1.0 (18-Aug-2013)

* Updated the Set Red/Green/Blue function to better match Hue device capabilities.
* Added a Set xyY Chromaticity (Advanced) action that allows one to directly specify the x/y chromaticity and Y luminosity values for devices that can render color.
--

* Fixed bug that caused the plugin to crash when using a LightStrip device.
--
1.0.2 (09-Aug-2013)
* Added ability to recognize new LightStrips and "wall washer" strips.
--
1.0.1 (30-Jul-2013)
* Added the indigoPluginUpdateChecker module (code by Travis CooK) to facilitate automatic plugin version checking.
--
1.0 (03-Jul-2013)
* Updated brightness status code to accurately reflect a 1 percent brightness level (rather than rounding up to 2 percent).
* Added Default Brightness property for Hue Bulbs devices so their features are more consistent with other lighting devices in Indigo (such as SwitchLinc and LampLinc Dimmers).
* Changed "on", "off", and "toggle" action control functions so that sending an "on" command to a Hue Bulb from within Indigo returns the bulb to its previous brightness level, or its default brightness level (if set).
* Updated Brightness, HSB, and Color Temperature setting methods so that they properly save the brightness level specified in those actions to the Hue Bulb's device properties for recall should an "on" command be sent to it.
* Updated the bulb status gathering method so that if the bulb brightness changes outside of the Hue Lights plugin (or the hub updates the bulb brightness during a long transition time), Hue Lights does not save the new brightness to the bulb properties and thus causing an "on" command later to recall an incorrect previous brightness state.
* Changed the logging slightly to more closely match the log format of native INSTEON device changes.
--
0.10.2 (24-Jun-2013)
* Added more code to work better with LivingWhites bulbs.
--
0.10.1 (24-Jun-2013)
* Modified debugging code so it wouldn't throw errors when the plugin is installed on versions of Indigo Pro earlier than version 5.1.7.
* Added the LWB003 model ID to the list of recognized Hue models.
--
0.10.0 (12-Jun-2013)
* Added a Hue Bulb Attribute Controller virtual dimmer device which can be created to control a specific attribute (hue, saturation, RGB levels, or color temperature) of an existing Hue Lights bulb device.
* Added an "Effect" action which allows you to specify an effect to be turned on for a Hue bulb (requires latest firmware on the Hue hub. Currently, only the Color Loop effect is supported by the Hue hub and bulbs).
* Changed light control methods so that if the current light brightness is below 6% and the requested action is to turn off the bulb, set the ramp rate to 0 regardless of the default or specified ramp rate (transition time) because going from a brightness of 6% or lower to an off state with a dimming rate isn't noticeable.
--
0.9.11 (10-Apr-2013)
* Updated code to more elegantly handle non-Hue devices attached to the Hue hub.
--
0.9.10 (02-Apr-2013)
* Fixed a bug that would cause the plugin to crash if a registered bulb on the Hue hub had no "hue" attribute (which could happen when using "LivingWhites" plugin dimmers found in some European countries).
--
0.9.9 (24-Jan-2013)
* Attempted to make RGB-to-xyY conversions more accurate by changing the illuminant used by the colormath functions from type "a" to type "e".
--
0.9.8 (23-Jan-2013)
* Fixed a bug that would crash the plugin if no device was selected in a start/stopBrightening/Dimming action when the action was executed.
* Fixed a bug that would cause an error during device creation dialog validation for new Hue Light devices in Indigo 5.x.
--
0.9.7 (31-Dec-2012)
* Fixed a bug that updated the "hue" state of plugin devices with an invalid number when the setHSB action was used.
--
0.9.6 (31-Dec-2012)
* Fixed a divide by zero error in getBulbStatus that could happen if the Hue hub returns no value for a bulb’s color temperature.
--
0.9.5 (27-Dec-2012)
* Fixed bug that would cause the Hue light not to turn off if using RGB mode when Red, Green, and Blue were all zero.
--
0.9.4 (27-Nov-2012)
* Fixed bug that would return an error if no default ramp rate were entered for a Hue bulb device.
* Added more debug logging.
* Changed how logging is done to be more consistent with other Indigo device update events. A log entry now appears after the physical device has changed (as was always the case) but now it appears before the Indigo device state is updated.
* Increased delay between status update requests to about 8 seconds to decrease number of requests per minute sent to the Hue hub.
--
0,9.3 (18-Nov-2012)
* Fixed typo (bug) that caused the plugin to crash when the Hue hub was unreachable within the timeout period.
* Worked around a colormath bug that would throw a ZeroDivisionError if the "y" component was zero.
* Added checks in bulb status gathering to prevent unnecessary Indigo device status updates. Added logging for any device brightness updates detected.
* Added more exception handling for HTTP requests to hub.
* Slightly tweaked status request timing.
--
0.9.2 (17-Nov-2012)
* Corrected error in actionControlDimmerRelay that prevented setBrightness call from working.
--
0.9.1 (16-Nov-2012)
* Tweaked brightening and dimming timing for Start Brightening and Start Dimming actions so the rate was about the same speed as SmartLabs SwithcLinc Dimmers and LampLinc Dimmers.
* Removed code that immediately changes the RGB color states for the Indigo device as the values entered by the user are not actual displayed values. Actual values will be updated by the getBulbStatus method later.
* Added the "Set Brightness with Ramp Rate" action and associated plugin.py code. Renamed multiple methods for easier readability and for easier plugin scripting within Indigo.  Reorganized order in which methods appear in the source code for a more logical layout.
--
0.9 (13-Nov-2012)
* Initial Nathan Sheldon forked beta release.
* This version removes the use of the "ColorPy" library from Alistair's version and replaces it with the "colormath" library as it includes the ability to specify a target illumination source during color conversion, thus presenting a closer RGB to xyY conversion (and vice-versa).
* Most of Alistair's original code was rewritten to remain consistent with coding conventions in my other plugins, but some of his code is still in here.
